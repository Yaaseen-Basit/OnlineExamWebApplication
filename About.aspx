            MyExam Center is Online Test System that allows a student (s) to take online 
            test and have the capability to view his / her score immediately after taking 
            the online exam. The student is also given the opportunity to view both the 
            correct and incorrect solutions. Thus, this will give the student opportunity to 
            hopefully improve on the next time if some of the same answers or presented.
